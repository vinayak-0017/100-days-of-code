# 100 Days Of Code - Log



### Day 1: July 5, Wed

**Today's Progress**: Leant basics of javascript and solved 3 leetcode problems.

**Thoughts** I started to code again after procastinating for a long time, spent a lot of time solving bugs in leetcode, its 6:02 AM and honestly it feels realy good to be back on track again.
